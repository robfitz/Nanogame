				Lets start by making a stretchable electronic circuit. 
			</line>
			<line>
				Creating a circuit that can be stretched or flexed would allow us to put electronic systems into the fabric of clothes or even inside the human body. 
			</line>
			<line>
				The secret is start with a versatile stretchy substance you can build your circuit on. A chemical called PDMS is ideal.

				Find the weighing scales and weigh out XXg of PDMS

				PDMS stands for Polydimethylsiloxane. It’s a clear, non-reactive, non-toxic, silicon-based substance. Liquid PDMS is used in shampoos to make your hair look shiny. Solid PDMS is used to make contact lenses.

				You control its consistency by adding XX??, a curing agent/cross linker?? Let’s add XXml.

				The PDMS is now beginning to transform from a liquid into a rubbery substance.

				Before it solidifies we need to remove any air bubbles and shape it into a thin layer. Better hurry up!
