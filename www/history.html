                      Nanotechnology now impacts us all, whether we know it or not. In an explosion of research papers and patents, nanoscience is shaping our lives from communications systems to cancer treatment, space transport to high fashion. In the words of Professor Gabriel Aeppli of the London Centre for Nanotechnology:  &ldquo;I wouldn't call it a discipline, I'd call it a toolkit&rdquo;.

                    Binnig, Quate and Gerber invent the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), a new member of the scanning probe microcopy family. For the first time, using forces on the nanoscale, three dimensional topographical imaging can be carried out on non-conductive and conductive surfaces. This allows routine imaging of molecular and biological systems without the need for destructive sample preparations.

By placing a sharp metallic tip just above a conductive surface, electrons are allowed to &ldquo;tunnel&rdquo; between the two metals.

                    Max Knoll and Ernst Ruska use an accelerated beam of electrons to image materials, building the first Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM). Prior to this, microscopes using light sources can only image objects larger than the wavelength of visible light (a theoretical resolution limit of around 200 nm). With their much shorter wavelengths, the electrons image objects previously far too small to see: the door flies open to an invisible world.

                    With no way of directly observing our universal building blocks, a number of exciting new theories are proposed about how atoms are constructed. J. J. Thomson (1904) proposes that atoms are modeled with positive and negative charges mixed up inside them like a ‘plum pudding. This is ultimately shown to be false by Rutherford’s gold foil experiment. His interpretation of the experimental data leads him to formulate the Rutherford model of the atom in 1911 — that a very small positively charged nucleus, containing much of the atom's mass, is orbited by low-mass electrons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is further expanded in 1913 by Niels Bohr who introduces the concept of electrons traveling in orbits around a small, positively charged nucleus. Bohr also introduces the idea that an electron can drop from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a photon (light quantum) of discrete energy. This becomes a basis for quantum theory. A century later we are still expanding our understanding of atomic structures and properties.

                    To represent the world until now, human hands had to draw, paint or
                    engrave. In 1827 Joseph Niépce produces the first true photograph, a
                    representation of the world formed by radiation. He uses a film containing silver halides which, when exposed to light, decompose into nanoparticles of silver. These form the pixels of the image, the first photograph.

                    Roman glassblowers unwittingly use the principles of nanotechnology to make an extraordinarily ingenious “Lycurgus Cup”. This is a glassware flask that changes from green when illuminated with diffuse light, to red when illuminated with direct light. It does this because the glassmakers include quantities of gold and silver salts into the glass. When these turn into metallic nanoparticles they exhibit unusual optical effects, which the Romans exploit. This is one of the earliest objects to survive to this day whose properties can be explained with nanoscience.
