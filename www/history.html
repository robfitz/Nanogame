                      A researcher called Angela Belcher and her colleagues at MIT built a nano-scale lithium-ion battery using a virus (nonharmful to humans), they have the same energy properties as cutting-edge rechargeable batteries and making them doesn’t harm the environment. Viruses could soon be powering your electronic devices.

                    Invented by Gerd Binning and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM’s research lab in Zurich, the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM) scans a tip of a probe above the surface of something, sensing tiny differences in how far electrons travel, and so mapping the surface.

                  </p>
                    But the STM isn’t just a tool for not only investigating and imaging individual atoms and their structures, the probe can manipulating them too! Humans could now move around the fundamental units of the universe.

                    Erwin Muller created a new kind of microscope, the Field Ion Microscope (FIM). This is so powerful that for the first time in our history, the arrangement of individual atoms, the particles whose existence we’ve been debating for thousands of years,  can finally be seen.

                    It shouldn’t be surprising that the history of nanoscience is tied into the history of being able to look at very small things. Light microscopes could only look at objects larger than the wavelength of visible light (0.4 – 0.7 micrometers). But Max Knot and Erst Ruska used an accelerated beam of electrons in the Transmitting Electron Microscope (TEM), with their much shorter wavelengths the electrons could help image objects previously far too small to see, the door was flung open to an invisible world.

                    With no way of directly observing our universal building blocks, there were a number of exciting new theories about how atoms were structured. J. J. Thomson (1904) proposed that atoms were modelled with positive and negative charges mixed up inside them like a ‘plum pudding. Rutherford’s 1911 research proved this model to be incorrect, that there was a central nucleus. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And in 1913 Niels Bohr described the atom as having electrons that travel in circular orbits around a small, positively charged nucleus. This was closer, but a century later we are still expanding our understanding of atomic structures and properties.

                    To represent the world until now, human hands had to draw, paint or engrave. In 1827  Joseph Niepce produced the first true photograph, a representation of the world formed by radiation. He used a film containing silver halides, when exposed to light these decomposed into nanoparticles of silver, these formed the pixels of the image, the first photograph.

                    Telescopes had recently given humans their first glimpses of huge objects far away, and using the same revolutionary ground glass technology, Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a fabric trader, used to scrutinizing his weave, built the first microscope.

                    With just one lens he suddenly found himself exploring a world much closer, where pond water swarmed with previously invisible animalcules, and fleas were complex and hairy. As the technology spread were able to discover the hidden worlds all around, and others more inside us.

                    Perhaps the first use of nanotechnology which survives to this day is the ancient Roman Lycurgus Cup. A glassware flask that changes from green when illuminated from the outside, to red, when illuminated from within. It does this because the glassmakers integrated nanoparticles of gold and silver into the vessel, when these metals are broken into tiny particles they have unusual optical effects, which the Romans exploited.
