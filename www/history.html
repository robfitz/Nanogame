                    Angela Belcher and colleagues at MIT built a lithium-ion battery with a common type of virus that is nonharmful to humans, using a low-cost and environmentally benign process. The batteries have the same energy capacity and power performance as state-of-the-art rechargeable batteries being considered to power plug-in hybrid cars, and they could also be used to power personal electronic devices.

                    Invented by Gerd Binning and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM’s research lab in Zurich.  This invention allows scientists not only to observe nanoscale particles, atoms and small molecules, but to control them. The STM scans the tip of a needle or probe above the surface of a sample a voltage is applied between the tip and the surface as the current begins to flow, the STM can determine minute variations in t he distance electrons travel and thus maps the surface of the sample.

                    Binning and Rohrer were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1986.

                    The development of nano technology has been dependent on advances in scientific instrumentation. In 1951 Erwin Muller invented the field ion-electron microscope. For the first time in history individual atoms and their arrangement on a surface could be seen.  Magnification of more than 2,000,000 times.

                    Light microscopes are unable to recognise object that were smaller than the wavelength of visible light (0.4 – 0.7 micrometers) to see particles smaller than this scientists had to bypass light all together and use a different kind of “illumination” one with a shorter wavelength.

                  <p>
                    In 1931 german scientists Max Knot and Erst Ruska developed and entirely new type of microscope that would eventually open up a new, small world.  In an electron microscope electons are accelerated in a vacuum until their wavelength is extremely short.  Beam of these fast moving electrons are focussed on a sample parts of a sample soak up the electrons other parts scatter them.  An electron sensitive photographic plate records this action and creates and image

                  <h3>Atoms Imagined</h3>
                  <p>
                    In Ancient Greece, Leucippus and his pupil Democritus propose that all matter is composed of small indivisible particles called atoms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  INSTEAD OF ALL THE UNIVERSE BEING FULL OF ONE CONTINOUS STUFF. THERE ARE BITS WHERE THERE ARE SOME SMALL PARTICLES OF DIFFERENT KINDS WHICH CAN FLY AROUND OR BE STATIONARY AND THERE CAN BE GAPS 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  SO IF YOU CUT CLAY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN YOU'D EVENTUALLY GET TO AN INDIVISIBLE UNIT
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The theory of Democritus and Leucippus held that everything is composed of "atoms", which are physically, but not geometrically, indivisible; that between atoms lies empty space; that atoms are indestructible; have always been, and always will be, in motion; that there are an infinite number of atoms, and kinds of atoms, which differ in shape, and size
