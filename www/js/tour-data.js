    name: "Scanning Electron Microscope",
    description: "The SEM scans a finely focused beam of electrons across the surface of a sample. The beam interacts with atoms at the surface of the sample generating signals that are detected to reconstruct an image. The resolution of an SEM is typically 5nm (that’s around 40 times more detail than an ordinary optical microscope). It provides images with good depth of field and useful information about the chemical composition, structure, magnetic and electrical characteristics of the sample."

    name: "Transmission Electron Microscope",
    description: "The TEM works by transmitting a focused beam of electrons through a sample. Parts of the sample are transparent to the electrons other parts deflect electrons. When the beam emerges it holds information about the sample's structure and is recorded by a sensor to reconstruct an image. The latest high-resolution transmission electron microscopes (HRTEM) have a resolution below 0.05nm and can determine the position of atoms within materials. A disadvantage of the TEM is that samples need to be extremely thin, typically around 100nm."

    name: "Atomic Force Microscope",
    description: "The AFM scans the surface of a sample with an extremely sharp tip - a bit like an old record player needle but much, much smaller, just 10nm in diameter at its point. As the tip moves above the surface of the sample it is repelled by or attracted by intermolecular interactions between the atoms in the tip and the surface. The magnitude of deflection is monitored and used to generate a 3D image of the surface of the sample."

    name: "Scanning Tunnelling Microscope",
    description: "The STM scans a sharp tip above the surface of a sample. When the tip is brought very close to the surface, a voltage difference applied between the tip and the surface allows electrons to exploit a quantum mechanical property called 'tunnelling' and travel through the vacuum between them. As the tip scans above the surface the varying tunnelling current is monitored and used to reconstruct an image. The STM has around 0.1nm lateral resolution and 0.01nm depth resolution and can be used to image, and even manipulate, individual atoms."

    description: "The sputter coater is used to deposit a thin film of a desired material onto a surface. The internal chamber is filled with a ‘sputtering gas’ such as argon. A current is then applied to a metal ‘target’ generating a plasma that results in the target metal ejecting atoms that gather on the sample surface in a thin layer."

    name: "Atomic Layer Deposition",
    description: "The ALD machine allows a thin film of a specific material to be deposited onto a surface. Most ALD procedures use two chemicals. In a typical reaction the sample is placed in a sealed chamber and the first chemical is introduced as a gas. Atoms within the gas gather on the surface of the sample. The chamber is then cleared and a second chemical gas is introduced. This reacts with the first to form a chemical layer on the surface of the sample. The cycle is then repeated and can be finely controlled to create atomic scale thin films."

    name: "Spin Coater",
    description: "The spin coater is used to apply a uniform thin film to a surface. A solution is placed on the surface, which is then rotated at speed causing the fluid to spread out until the desired thickness is reached. Spin coating can be used to create thin films less than 10 nm thick."
