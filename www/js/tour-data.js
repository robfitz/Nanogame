    name: "Scanning Electron Microscope",
    description: "The SEM uses electron-sample interactions to image materials at the micro- and nanoscale. By firing a focused beam of electrons at a sample, information can be obtained about the texture, chemical composition, crystalline structure of the materials by sensing the energy exchanges between electron and sample. The spatial resolution of an SEM is typically a few nm and the best microscopes can reveal sample details less than 1 nm in size (around 250 times the magnification limit of a good optical microscope)."

    name: "Transmission Electron Microscope",
    description: "The TEM works by transmitting a focused beam of high-energy electrons through an ultra thin sample. By sensing the way the beam interacts with the sample (from energy exchanges and electron scattering), information about the sample's structural and chemical morphology is obtained down to the atomic level. The latest high-resolution transmission electron microscopes (HRTEM) have a spatial resolution below 0.05nm."

    name: "Atomic Force Microscope",
    description: "The AFM scans the surface of a sample with an extremely sharp tip - a bit like an old record player needle but much, much smaller: just 10nm in diameter at its point. As the tip moves over the surface of the sample it is repelled by or attracted by intermolecular interactions between the atoms in the tip and the surface. The magnitude of deflection is monitored by lasers and used to generate a 3D image of the surface of the sample."

    name: "Scanning Tunnelling Microscope",
    description: "The STM scans a sharp tip above the surface of a sample. When the tip is brought very close to the surface, a voltage difference applied between the tip and the surface allows electrons to exploit a quantum mechanical property called 'tunneling' and travel through the vacuum between them. As the tip scans over the surface the tunneling current is monitored (and often kept constant) and the tip’s vertical movement is used to reconstruct an image. The STM has around 0.1nm lateral resolution and 0.01nm depth resolution and can be used to image, and even manipulate, individual atoms."

    name: "Sputter Coater",
    description: "The sputter coater is used to deposit a thin film of a desired material onto a surface, typically metals such as gold. The internal chamber is filled with a ‘sputtering gas’ such as argon. Metal atoms are ejected from the solid target due to bombardment of the target by energetic ionized argon. These ejected atoms coat the sample surface with a thin layer."

    name: "Atomic Layer Deposition",
    description: "The ALD machine allows a thin film of a specific material to be deposited onto a surface. Most ALD procedures use two chemicals. In a typical reaction the sample is placed in a sealed chamber and the first chemical is introduced as a gas. Atoms within the gas gather on the surface of the sample. The chamber is then cleared and a second chemical gas is introduced. This reacts with the first to form a chemical layer on the surface of the sample. The cycle is then repeated and can be finely controlled to create atomic scale thin films."

    description: "Evaporation is a common method for thin film deposition. A sample is loaded into the top of a vacuum chamber. Once the pressure is low a metal pellet placed at the bottom of the chamber (such as gold) is heated until it melts and evaporates, releasing vaporized particles into the chamber. These travel up through the chamber and condense on the sample surface. "

The ions strike the sample surface, the energy of which cause species such as secondary ions and electrons to be released by sputtering. These electrons can be detected and used for imaging. If the ion beam has high enough energy, a large quantity of material can be sputtered from the surface and the beam can be used for precision milling of patterns on the sample. "

Particles smaller than the pore size pass through the walls of the bag, particles larger than the pore size remain in the bag. "
